Protogame "Asteroids" Template
================================

This template implements the game of Asteroids in Protogame.  It covers the following topics:

- How to create componentized entities
- How to manage, add and remove entities and components
- How to restart worlds
- How to load and render textures
- How to detect 2D per-pixel collisions

Getting Started
------------------

We'll be adding this template to the Protobuild Manager in the near future.  In the mean time, you can create this template from the command-line with:

```
Protobuild.exe --start https-git://www.github.com/RedpointGames/Protogame.Template.Asteroids
```

Just download [Protobuild.exe](https://github.com/Protobuild/Protobuild/raw/master/Protobuild.exe) and place it in an empty folder where you want to create your project.
